Tutorial on how to setup a macOS Sierra Virtual Machine

For my projects I make use of macOS Sierra Virtual Machine, as I like to devide security research, development and personal use.
I can imagine more people would like to organize their environments like that, therefore I will help you setting up a VM.

## Requirements
- At least 4GB of ram (bare minimum), 8GB would be way better
- A intel core i3, i5, i7 or Xeon Quad or Eightcore processor (Any Intel processor will do, but these are the best).
- Around 80GB of free harddisk space.
- VMWare Workstation (not player, as that will not have VMWare tools).
- Windows 7 or Higher (x64), Linux 64-bit.

## Setup
- For the best VM usage, disable unnecessary Windows animations, C:\Windows\System32\SystemPropertiesPerformance.exe
- You will need to have a license key for VMWare Workstation.
- Here are some licenses that can be used.
